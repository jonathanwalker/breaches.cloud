This is the first breaches.cloud monthly update since going live in May. Not much has happened in the way of new breaches. I was busy organizing the fourth annual [fwd:cloudsec](https://www.fwdcloudsec.org) conference in Anaheim, then attending [AWS re:Inforce](https://reinforce.awsevents.com/).

So far in June we learned:

* Nickolas Sharp was [sentenced to six years in prison](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ex-ubiquiti-engineer-behind-breathtaking-data-theft-gets-6-year-prison-term/) for his role in the [2020 Ubiquti](https://www.breaches.cloud/incidents/ubiquiti/) hack.
* Toyota disclosed they had an incident with S3
* Security Researcher [Anurag Sen](https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha) found an "online database" with a large amount of PII from Shellâ€™s EV charging stations. [Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/) at TechCrunch [has the write up](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/shell-recharge-security-lapse-exposed-drivers-data/).
* While not a breach, Microsoft suffered [a serious DDOS attack](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-response-to-layer-7-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
