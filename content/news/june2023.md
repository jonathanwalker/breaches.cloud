Welcome to the first breaches.cloud monthly update since going live in May. Not much has happened in the way of new breaches, but we did learn more from the FTC about public S3 buckets at [Vitagene](/incidents/vitagene/). I was busy organizing the fourth annual [fwd:cloudsec](https://www.fwdcloudsec.org) conference in Anaheim, then attending [AWS re:Inforce](https://reinforce.awsevents.com/).

<!--more--> <!-- This separates the synopsis from the main body -->

So far in June, we learned the following:

* Nickolas Sharp was [sentenced to six years in prison](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ex-ubiquiti-engineer-behind-breathtaking-data-theft-gets-6-year-prison-term/) for his role in the [2020 **Ubiquti** hack](https://www.breaches.cloud/incidents/ubiquiti/).
* After conducting a thorough inspection of their cloud environment after [discovering a “cloud misconfiguration”](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/toyota-japan-exposed-millions-locations-videos/), **Toyota**, [disclosed a second incident](https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39241625.html?053123) (Write up from [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/toyota-customer-data-leak-years/)).
* Security Researcher [Anurag Sen](https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha) found an "online database" with a large amount of PII from **Shell**’s EV charging stations. [Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/) at TechCrunch [has the write-up](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/shell-recharge-security-lapse-exposed-drivers-data/).
* While not a breach, **Microsoft** suffered [a serious DDOS attack](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-response-to-layer-7-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/) against O365 and Azure.
* The FTC [issued a decision and order against **Vitagene**](/incidents/vitagene/) for having a public bucket (among other bad business practices).
* The developers of the npm package **bignum** hosted some pre-compiled binaries in S3, and hard-coded the buckets in specific versions of their code. When they subsequently deleted the buckets, [hilarity ensued](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/19/npm_s3_buckets_malware/). From the Checkmarx [writeup](https://checkmarx.com/blog/hijacking-s3-buckets-new-attack-technique-exploited-in-the-wild-by-supply-chain-attackers/):
	> An NPM package, named “bignum” was found to leverage "node-gyp" for downloading a binary file during installation. The binary file was initially hosted on an Amazon AWS S3 bucket, which, if inaccessible, would prompt the package to look for the binary locally.
	>
	> However, an unidentified attacker noticed the sudden abandonment of a once-active AWS bucket. Recognizing an opportunity, the attacker seized the abandoned bucket. Consequently, whenever bignum was downloaded or re-installed, the users unknowingly downloaded the malicious binary file, placed by the attacker.
* [Permiso](https://permiso.io/) has an [excellent write up](https://permiso.io/blog/s/unmasking-guivil-new-cloud-threat-actor/) of an [alledged] Indonesian Threat Actor (dubbed **GUI-vil**) that applies an artisanal touch to cryptomining. Rather than rely on scripts and the AWS CLI, they operate mostly in S3 Browser and the AWS Console.
	> *In their typical attack lifecycle, GUI-vil initially performs reconnaissance by monitoring public sources for exposed AWS keys (GitHub, Pastebin) and scanning for vulnerable GitLab instances. Initial compromises are predominantly achieved via exploiting known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2021-22205, or via using publicly exposed credentials.*
* In a lesson on how not to manage password resets, a [High School in Illinois accidently wiped tier student passwords](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/high-school-changes-every-students-password-to-chngeme/), and then reset _all of them_ to `Ch@ngeme!`.
