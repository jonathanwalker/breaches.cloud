## Incident


### Details of the Incident


In April 2018, Chegg allowed a former contractor to retain access to their AWS Account using root credentials. No multi-factor authentication was enabled for the account. Additionally, Chegg neglected to encrypt employee and user information and used a weak hashing algorithm for the user passwords. In September 2018, a threat intelligence vendor discovered an online forum containing 25 million user passwords in plain text. In response, Chegg required 40 million customers to reset their passwords.

## Cloud Security lessons learned.


* Chegg did not issue individual access credentials to each employee. All employees and contractors used the same _shared_ set of credentials.
* Chegg did not use IAM for access to their customer data in S3, instead, they used the root account which has been[ against AWS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) for several years prior to the Chegg breach. 
* Chegg did not require MFA on the root AWS account.
* Chegg "failed to adequately monitor its networks and systems for unauthorized attempts to transfer or exfiltrate users’ and employees’ personal information".
